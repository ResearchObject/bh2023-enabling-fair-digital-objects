# Introduction

As part of the BioHackathon Europe 2023, we here report from the progress of the hackathon project #15: "Enabling FAIR Digital Objects with RO-Crate, Signposting and Bioschemas". 

# Background

[RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) is a lightweight method to package research outputs along with their metadata. [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) provides metadata schemas to add structured metadata to webpages on Life Science. [Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/) provides a lightweight yet powerful approach to increase the FAIRness of scholarly objects.

The combination of RO-Crates, Bioschemas and Signposting make resources easy to navigate by machines, provide an unambiguous way for machines to access FAIR metadata and content in a single request, and reduce content-negotiation hassle that can give unpredictable results.

This tripartite combination is of benefit for repositories and publishers as they can non-disruptively add FAIR Signposting headers for machine navigation, support RO-Crate imports and align with Bioschemas specifications, making FAIR Digital Objects achievable with existing technologies over HTTP.

FAIR tooling implementers can also benefit as they could create, improve or integrate Signposting clients combined with RO-Crate libraries implementing Bioschemas specifications. On its side, FAIR data implementers could support consumption of FAIR Signposting and create Knowledge Graphs from RO-Crates.

While Bioschemas has been adapted by many repositories, the methods for its consumption have largely been focused on discoverability. Now we focus on integrations, such as building scholarly knowledge graphs from multiple Bioschemas sources.

Finally, FAIR outreach practitioners showcase uses of FAIR Signposting to navigate and consume RO-Crates making FAIR closer to the community. This project will continue the effort started as part of FDO2022 and FAIR-IMPACT to enable FAIR Signposting and RO-Crate for content/metadata discovery and consumption.


# Initial plan

* Add metadata markup/headers to landing pages of at least one website
  - Drop-in for anyone to add FAIR Signposting for existing persistent identifiers and metadata resources
  - Drop-in for adding Bioschemas metadata to website
  - Drop-in for RO-Crate support  
* Improve at least one Signposting client
  - https://signposting.readthedocs.io/ (Python)
  - https://github.com/markwilkinson/linkheader-processor (Ruby)
  - Javascript?
  - Java/Jena?
  - Your language!
* Improve Bioschemas/RO-Crate validation for at least one profile (working with [#7](../17/))
* Prototype FAIR Digital Object (FDO) implementation using Signposting, PIDs and RO-Crate
* Conceptualise and draft FDO "configuration type" profile for Signposting-based FDO implementation
* Write up a BioHackrXiv preprint!
* Other ideas
  -  Prototype a knowledge graph from pages using any of the technologies (working with [#7](../17/))
  -  Build a validator for FAIR Signposting level 1, then level 2 - may be based on https://github.com/stain/signposting/ 

<!-- Markdown tips below:

# Formatting

This document use Markdown and you can look at [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of only two levels.

## Tables and figures

Tables can be added in the following way, though alternatives are possible:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

Table: Note that table caption is automatically numbered.

A figure is added with:

![Caption for BioHackrXiv logo figure](./biohackrxiv.png)

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Lists can be added with:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use CiTO annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate why you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
